#  Returns the screen (pixel based) coordinates of some (x, y) graph location base on configuration
#
#  Parameters:
#   xo, yo : the pixel location of the origin of the  graph
#   ratio: the ratio of pixels to single step in graph (i.e 1 step is ratio amount of pixels)
#   x, y: the graph location to change into a screen (pixel-based) location
#
#  Usage -> screenCoor(xo, yo, ratio, 1, 0)
#
#  Returns: (screenX, screenY) which is the graph location (x,y) as a pixel location in the window

#  Returns a string of the colour to use for the current expression being drawn
#  This colour is chosen based on which how many expression have previously been drawn
#  The counter starts at 0, the first or 0th expression, should be red, the second green, the third blue
#  then loops back to red, then green, then blue, again
#
#  Usage -> getColor(counter)
#
#  Parameters:
#  counter: an integer where the value is a count (starting at 0) of the expressions drawn
#
#  Returns: 0 -> "red", 1 -> "green", 2 -> "blue", 3 -> "red", 4 -> "green", etc.
